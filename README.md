# Flower-Type Classification Using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

This repository contains the implementation of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to predict the type of flower using the Iris dataset from scikit-learn. The project demonstrates the entire workflow, including data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

## Introduction

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. In this project, we use SVM to classify different types of Iris flowers based on their features.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning, consisting of 150 samples of iris flowers with 4 features each: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The dataset contains three classes, each representing a different type of iris flower: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flower-type_classification_using_Support-Vector-Machine.git
cd flower-type_classification_using_Support-Vector-Machine
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
You can run the Jupyter Notebook to see the complete workflow of data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

```bash
jupyter notebook Support_Vector_Machine.ipynb
```
## Results
The SVM classifier achieves high accuracy in predicting the type of iris flower. Detailed evaluation metrics and visualizations are provided in the Jupyter Notebook.
